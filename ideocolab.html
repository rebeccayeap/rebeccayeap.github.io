					<p>You asked: What would I do next?

						My team (Emily Deng, Hillary Hermawan, Santana Galgalikar) and I built a mobile application which uses real-time data and computer vision to match resources from donors to victims of natural disaster. After an intense but exciting experience at the makeathon, my main takeaway from my team debrief was to jump into prototyping earlier so we could more successfully convey and test our ideas.
					 </p>  
					<p>After reflecting on my experience, I wanted to challenge myself to build upon existing ideas and flush out two new features to test, so I spent the past few days thinking about the problem to inform a redesign of Saturdayâ€™s prototype. With even more time, I would want to test our prototype with our user to gauge the desirability of our solution as well as the feasibility and viability of working with shelters and non-profit organizations for distribution.</p>
