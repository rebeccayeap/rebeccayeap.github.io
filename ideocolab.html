					<p>What would you do next? 
My team (Emily Deng, Hillary Hermawan, Santana Galgalikar) and I built a mobile application which uses real-time data and computer vision to reallocate resources to victims of natural disaster. After an intense but exciting experience at the makeathon, my team’s main takeaway was that we should have jumped into prototyping earlier on so we would be more successful in conveying and testing our ideas. 
					 </p>  
					<p>After reflecting on my experience, I wanted to challenge myself to effectively convey our existing ideas and flush out two new features I would have wanted to test out, so I spent the past few days thinking about the problem to inform a redesign of Saturday’s prototype. With even more time, I would want to test our prototype with our user to gauge the desirability of our solution as well as the feasibility and viability of working with shelters and non-profit organizations for distribution.</p>
