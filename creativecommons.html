					<p>Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that works to increase “the commons”, the body of work that is available to the public for free and legal sharing, and use. In January 2018, Creative Commons kicked off an new initiative called <a href="https://medium.com/@janepk/findings-from-the-discovery-phase-of-cc-usability-3bde89d55a74">CC Usability</a> and found many important findings, one being the need for an archiving process. </p>

					<p>Archiving allows creators to have control over their content without the fear of losing their work when a platform goes under. CC Archiving is about users having control, ownership, and a safe space for their content. The Director of Product and Research at CC, Jane Park, explained the process as a way to "provide creators with the choice of archiving a version of their works when CC licensing. This could be an archive we provide as a service, tied to a new chooser tool, a separate web page for preserving your work, and also in partnership with an organization like the Internet Archive."

					<p>Currently, working with CC on this project.</p>
